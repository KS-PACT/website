      <h1>Kansas Partnership for Applied Computational Thinking</h1>
      <p>
        KS-PACT is a regional chapter of the Computer Science Teachers Association
        with a special mission &emdash; incorporating computation into K-12 curriculum not
        as its own discipline for its own sake, but rather, as a tool supporting
        other disciplines, i.e. music, literature, mathematics, science, and
        social studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        KS-PACT was formed as a partnership between Kansas State Computer Science
        and Education faculty and K-12 teachers who had been involved in programs
        sponsored by these departments like GK-12 INSIGHT and CI-TEAM.  Additionally,
        Kansas State University’s ACM-W student club – organized with the goal of
        increasing diversity in computing careers - has joined the team and will be
        helping answer teachers’ questions about CT and visiting K-12 classrooms to
        help with computing activities and work with students.
      </p>

      <p>
        KS-PACT will supply curriculum materials and software tools custom-designed
        for the needs of K-12 teachers to its members.  These materials will be
        available on the KS-PACT website, sorted by grade band and searchable by
        subject and specific standards.  The KS-PACT website also features a
        forum where teachers can pose questions they have about computing, and
        receive speedy responses from KSU Faculty and ACM-W students.  We also
        are offering sensor and computing equipment collected through past grant
        programs in a lending library that teachers can reserve for a week or
        two of use in their own classroom.
      </p>
